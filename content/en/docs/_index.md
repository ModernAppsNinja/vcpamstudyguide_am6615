## About the VMware Certified Professional - Application Modernization - Exam Number 2V0-71.21

The VCP-AM certification validates a candidateâ€™s expertise with VMware Tanzu Standard Edition including vSphere with Tanzu, Tanzu Kubernetes Grid and Tanzu Mission Control. This certification also demonstrates fundamental cloud native skills including containerization, Kubernetes, and application modernization.

The VCP-AM is a 55 question exam, which must be completed within 130 minutes.

## Preparing for the VCP-AM Exam

Before scheduling the exam, candidates are required to complete one of the following courses:

- [VMware vSphere with Tanzu: Deploy and Manage V7](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=93247)
- [VMware vSphere with Tanzu: Deploy and Manage V7 - On Demand](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=95134)
- [VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid: Install, Configure, Manage V1.0](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=93809)
- [VMware Tanzu Mission Control: Management and Operations 2020](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=93395)
- [Kubernetes Foundations](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=89562)
- [VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid: Install, Configure, Manage V1.3](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=96343)

**Important:** Because this exam covers multiple products, none of the required courses covers all exam topics, and candidates will need to thoroughly review the [official exam study guide](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/certification/vmware-vcp-am-exam-preparation-guide.pdf) to ensure adequate preparation for all exam topics.

Each of the courses listed above provide coverage of the exam topics related to the product covered in the course. Candidates should plan for additional study of the exam topics that are not included in the course(s) a user may choose to take. If a candidate were to take all of the above listed courses, they should provide complete coverage of all exam topics; However only one official course is required and many candidates prefer to take one course and self-study to gain adequate knowledge of all exam topics.

The following sections contain links to official certification materials, as well as additional courses and resources that provide additional information about the exam topic.
